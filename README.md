Animal intake form created via Java

Project Prompt:

We desire a software application that will help us track the animals we are currently training and the animals that have been placed into service. Here are some specifics:
• Ability to process requests for a rescue animal: In this case, we would receive the type of animal the customer wants and the country where the customer resides. If we have an animal in training in their country, we can reserve that animal for the customer.
• Ability to update any information we have on our animals
• Ability to see what animals we have in each phase at each location, including “intake” and “farm”
• Ability to add animals (intake)
• Ability to transfer service animals to the farm or place in-service
• Ability to view which animals are in-service
• Ability to process and receive reports from in-service agencies on the retirement or death of their rescue animal
